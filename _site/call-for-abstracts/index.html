        <p class="lead">The 4th Workshop on Processing and Evaluating Event Representations (PEER2025)</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>The organizers of the 4th Workshop on Processing and Evaluating Event Representations (PEER2025) invite submission of abstracts for 15-minute oral presentations on any topic in incremental linguistic processing or event semantics. Preference will be given to abstracts that address topics at the intersection of these two domains and that speak to the following (or related) questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What symbolic and continuous representations are necessary for capturing different aspects of linguistic meaning?</li>
  <li>How do we determine the psycholinguistic validity of such representations to better understand incremental processing in humans?</li>
  <li>How might the psycholinguistically valid representations be deployed during incremental language processing?</li>
</ol>

<p>PEER2025 will be held at the University of Rochester on April 18, 2025.</p>

<h2 id="submission-details">Submission details</h2>

<p>The deadline for abstract submission is <s><b>Friday, November 15, 2024</b></s> <strong>Tuesday, November 26, 2024</strong>, 11:59 pm (UTC-12). Submissions should be made via the <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=PEER/2025/Workshop">PEER2025 OpenReview site</a>. We expect to notify authors of their acceptance in mid-February 2025. Please note that you must have an OpenReview account to submit an abstract and that new OpenReview accounts can take some time to be approved.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>Abstracts must be anonymous. The main text should be at most one page (US Letter or A4) in length, with an optional second page for references, figures, or non-English examples. All English examples must be interleaved within the main text of the abstract. No prose may extend onto the second page and captions for figures on the second page must not exceed 100 characters in length.</p>

<p>English context descriptions for non-English examples may be placed on the second page alongside the example they are associated with, but they must obey the constraint for figure captions on the second page–i.e. they must not exceed 100 characters in length. If longer English context descriptions are necessary–even for non-English examples that themselves are placed on the second page–they must be interleaved within the main text of the abstract.</p>

<p>The abstract should use a font no smaller than 11pt for all text (including mathematical formulae, examples, figure captions, and footnotes), and its margins should be no smaller than 1 inch (for US Letter) or 3 cm margins (for A4) on all four sides. The line spacing must be no smaller than single space. The abstract must be submitted as a single PDF file. These limitations will be strictly enforced. In addition to the intellectual interest of the abstract, clarity and readability will also be taken into account in reviewing.</p>

<h2 id="policies">Policies</h2>

<p>Authors may be involved in an unlimited number of abstracts. PEER does not accept papers that at the time of the conference have been published or have been accepted for publication, but presentations may appear or have appeared at other workshops and/or conferences.</p>
