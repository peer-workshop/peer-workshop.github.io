description: The Workshop on Processing and Evaluating Event Representations
---

The Workshop on Processing and Evaluating Event Representations (PEER) brings together researchers working on incremental language understanding with researchers working on event semantics. It aims to address a variety of questions at the intersection of these domains:

1. What symbolic and continuous representations are necessary for capturing different aspects of linguistic meaning?
2. How do we determine the psycholinguistic validity of such representations to better understand incremental processing in humans?
3. How might the psycholinguistically valid representations be deployed during incremental language processing? 

Special focus is placed on meaning representations that take the concept of an event as a core organizing principle.

The 4th Workshop on Processing and Evaluating Event Representations (PEER2025) will be held at the University of Rochester on April 18, 2025. You can find the call for abstracts as well as the programs for previous iterations of PEER at the links below.
